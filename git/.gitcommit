# [<type>] <subject> (50 characters max)
# <BLANK LINE>
# <body> (72 characters per line max)
#
# --- TYPE ---
#
# The type must be one of the following:
#
#   init: Initial commit, usually a commit to set up a basic structure to start from
#   asset: A new asset
#   feat: A new feature
#   test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
#   drop: A feature/test or asset removal
#   fix: A bug fix
#   docs: Documentation changes
#   reformat: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g. indent line, trim space)
#   optimize: Changes that improve the performance of the code
#   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (improvements of the code structure)
#   conf: Changes to configuration files (e.g. build process or auxiliary tools, libraries such as documentation generation)
#   deps: A dependency removal or changes to dependency versions
#
# --- SUBJECT ---
#
# The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
#
#   Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
#   Don't capitalize the first letter
#   No dot (.) at the end
#
# --- BODY ---
#
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
