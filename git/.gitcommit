# <BLANK LINE>
# <footer>
#
# --- TYPE ---
#
# The type must be one of the following:
#   
#    feat: A new feature
#    fix: A bug fix
#    docs: Documentation only changes
#    style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
#    refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (improvements of the code structure)
#    perf: A code change that improves the performance
#    test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
#    build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm)
#    ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: travis, circle)
#    chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
#    revert: Reverts a previous commit
#
# --- SCOPE ---
# 
# The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).
#
# --- SUBJECT ---
#
# The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
#
#   Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
#   Don't capitalize the first letter
#   No dot (.) at the end
#
# --- BODY ---
#
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
